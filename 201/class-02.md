# code in a content management SyStem:

altering one template is a lot easier than changing the page for each individual product.In systems like this, when you have a large block of text that you can edit, such as a news article, blog entry or the description of a product in an e-commerce store, you will often see a text editor displayed. **Text** editors usually have controls a little like those on your word processor, giving you different options to style text, add links or insert images. 

Behind the scenes these editors are adding HTML code to your **text**, just like the code you have seen earlier in this chapter.Many of these editors will have an option that allows you to see (and edit) the code that they produce.Once you know how to read and edit this code, you can take more control over these sections of your website.In the example above, you can see that the **text** editor has a tab for Visual / HTML views of what the user enters. Other systems might have a button (which often shows angle brackets) to indicate how to access the code.

When the web was first taking off, one of the most common ways to learn about HTML and discover new tips and techniques was to look at the source code that made up web pages.

+ HTML pages are text documents.
+ XHTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled Xbrackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
+ Tags are often referred to as elements.
+ XTags usually come in pairs. 
+ The opening tag denotes Xthe start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more Xabout the content of that element.
+ Attributes require a name and a value.
+ XTo learn HTML you need to know what tags are Xavailable for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

# TEXT

When creating a web page, you add tags **(known as markup)** to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.
